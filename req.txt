I am looking for a skilled freelancer to design an Elastic Optical Network using Machine Learning with a focus on Fault Detection and Recovery. The ideal candidate will have experience with Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The desired outcome of the project is improved network efficiency. 

Skills and Experience:
- Strong knowledge of Elastic Optical Network design and architecture
- Experience with Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms
- Expertise in Fault Detection and Recovery techniques
- Ability to optimize network efficiency and reduce downtime
- Familiarity with resource allocation optimization methods 



---------------------------


 The objective is to produce efficient spectrum allocation in Elastic optical network  using machine learning using a novel design and idea. I dont have any data set and you can use any algorithm .Let me know if you can do it. 

 so you have no any data or reference? 

 I can give reference papers 

 But I dont have data set 

 I will send in few minutes 

 I checked this pdf 

 I think I can handle it 

 I will check and say .Let me know if could be done in one week ? 

 Again to be more clear. I have two criteria.
1.You can take any base paper in elastic optical network and improve the efficiency .
2.The design should be novel and involve machine learning(reinforcement learning).

 ok.when can you show me the novel design? 

 I need an abstract or summary of what we are going to implement .Design with RL  .The design to be done for NSFNet topology. 

 A design with simple block diagram is fine 

 it should be in preceding paper? 

 i can use any design? 

 Any design that suits elastic optical network is fine  

 Is it possible for you to collect datavset? 

 
 Hopefully , we will get a novel design  for elastic optical network to increase spectrum allocation  in three days .
